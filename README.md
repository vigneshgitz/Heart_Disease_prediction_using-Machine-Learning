# Heart_Disease_prediction_using-Machine-Learning
This project is focused on building a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on their medical parameters. The model is trained using the UCI Heart Disease dataset and leverages various classification algorithms to ensure accuracy and reliability.

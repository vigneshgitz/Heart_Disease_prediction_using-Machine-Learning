 💓 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Overview  
This project is focused on building a machine learning model that can **predict the likelihood of heart disease** in individuals based on their medical parameters. The model is trained using the **UCI Heart Disease dataset** and leverages various classification algorithms to ensure accuracy and reliability.

🎯 Objectives  
- Predict the presence of heart disease based on key medical attributes  
- Compare multiple ML models for performance  
- Provide a tool for early diagnosis to assist healthcare providers

🧠 Algorithms Used  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Dataset:** [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)

 📊 Features Used  
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type (cp)  
- Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)  
- Cholesterol (chol)  
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)  
- Rest ECG (restecg)  
- Max Heart Rate (thalach)  
- Exercise-induced angina (exang)  
- ST depression (oldpeak)  
- Number of major vessels (ca)  
- Thalassemia (thal)

 📈 Model Evaluation  
Models are evaluated using:  
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Curve

 ✅ Outcome  
The final model provides reliable predictions with good accuracy and helps in early detection of heart disease, potentially saving lives through timely intervention.
